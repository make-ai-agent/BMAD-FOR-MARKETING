# BMAD Marketing Team Framework

> **AI-driven marketing automation system that applies software development methodologies to marketing operations**

The BMAD (Brand, Media, Analyst, Designer) Framework enables data-driven marketing decisions through intelligent automation and cross-functional collaboration, supporting both Greenfield (new initiatives) and Brownfield (optimization) marketing scenarios.

There is a korean version: [korean version](./README-ko.md)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Marketing Team Approach

The BMAD framework provides **AI-powered marketing agents** that work as an integrated team:

```bash
# Activate marketing agents individually
@brand-marketer    # Sofia - Brand Marketing Strategist 🎨
@media-buyer       # Marcus - Performance Marketing Specialist 📊
@marketing-analyst # Elena - Marketing Data Analyst 📈
@marketing-designer # Maya - Creative Marketing Designer 🎨
```

### 2. Identify Your Business Type

Use our business type analysis to determine your configuration:

```bash
# Review available business types
cat config/business_types.yaml
```

**Answer these key questions:**

- How does your company primarily make money?
- Who are your primary customers (B2B/B2C)?
- How long is your typical sales cycle?
- What are your most important conversion events?

### 3. Start with Your Marketing Team

The four AI agents work together as an integrated marketing team:

| Agent                 | Name      | Role                             | Primary Commands                                               |

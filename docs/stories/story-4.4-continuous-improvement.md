# Story 4.4: Continuous Improvement Processes

## Story

As a Team, we want to establish a continuous improvement process, so that the BMAD framework evolves and improves over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A regular cadence for retrospective meetings is established (e.g., monthly).
2. A process for proposing, prioritizing, and implementing improvements to the framework is documented.
3. A backlog for framework improvements is created and maintained.
4. The first improvement from the backlog is implemented using the new process.
5. The continuous improvement process is added to the team's knowledge base.

## QA Plan

- Verify that the continuous improvement process is well-documented and easy to follow.
- Confirm that the backlog is being used to track potential improvements.
- Observe the implementation of the first improvement from the backlog.

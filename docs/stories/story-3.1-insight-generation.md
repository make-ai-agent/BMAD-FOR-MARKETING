# Story 3.1: AI-driven Insight Generation Implementation

## Story

As a Developer, I want to implement the AI-driven insight generation module, so that the team can receive automated recommendations for optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A script is developed that takes the integrated data from Epic 2 as input.
2. The script uses a large language model (LLM) API to analyze the data based on the prompts from the prompt library.
3. The system generates at least one actionable insight for each of the four roles.
4. The generated insights are stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
5. The code is modular and includes unit tests.

## QA Plan

- Review the code for quality and adherence to standards.
- Verify that the generated insights are relevant and actionable.
- Check that the unit tests provide adequate coverage.

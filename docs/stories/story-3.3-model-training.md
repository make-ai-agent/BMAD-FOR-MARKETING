# Story 3.3: Advanced Analytics Model Training

## Story

As an Analyst, I want to train an advanced analytics model, so that we can move from reporting on the past to predicting future outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A predictive model is developed to forecast a key metric (e.g., customer lifetime value or conversion rate).
2. The model is trained on the historical data collected in the previous epics.
3. The model's accuracy is evaluated and documented.
4. The trained model is saved as an artifact that can be used for future predictions.
5. The entire process is documented in a Jupyter Notebook or similar format.

## QA Plan

- Review the code and methodology used for model training.
- Verify the model's accuracy metrics.
- Ensure the process is reproducible by running the notebook.

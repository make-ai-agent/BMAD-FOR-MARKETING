# Story 4.2: Advanced Automation Features

## Story

As a Developer, I want to implement advanced automation features, so that we can reduce manual effort and increase the efficiency of the marketing team.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An opportunity for advanced automation is identified (e.g., automated budget reallocation based on performance).
2. A technical design for the automation feature is created and approved.
3. The feature is implemented and includes appropriate safeguards (e.g., manual approval before execution).
4. The feature is tested in the sandbox environment.
5. The feature is documented for the team.

## QA Plan

- Review the technical design and implementation.
- Verify that the safeguards work as expected.
- Confirm that the feature is well-documented and easy to use.

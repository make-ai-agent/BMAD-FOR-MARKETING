# Story 1.3: Initial Prompt Library and Workflow Documentation

## Story

As a Product Manager, I want to create an initial prompt library and document the core workflows, so that the team has a clear operational guide for using the BMAD framework.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A detailed workflow map for both Greenfield and Brownfield scenarios is created using a digital whiteboard tool.
2. Each of the four roles develops and documents at least 5 initial prompts.
3. A central knowledge base (e.g., Confluence, Notion, or a markdown file in `docs/workflows`) is created.
4. The documented workflows and prompt library are stored in the knowledge base.
5. The entire team reviews and approves the initial workflows and prompts.

## Technical Notes for Dev Agent

- This is a documentation and process-definition story.
- The agent will facilitate the creation of workflow diagrams and markdown documents.

## Tasks / Sub-tasks

- [ ] Create a new `docs/workflows` directory.

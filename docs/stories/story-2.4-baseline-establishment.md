# Story 2.4: Performance Baseline Establishment

## Story

As an Analyst, I want to establish a performance baseline, so that we have a benchmark to measure the impact of our future marketing activities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Key metrics from the PRD (e.g., CAC, ROAS, conversion rate) are collected for the 30 days prior to the project start.
2. The baseline data is compiled into a formal report.
3. The report includes visualizations for the key metrics.
4. The baseline report is reviewed and approved by the Product Manager.
5. The report is stored in the `docs/project-planning` directory.

## QA Plan

- Verify the accuracy of the data in the baseline report against the source systems.
- Check the clarity and correctness of the visualizations.
- Confirm that the report is stored in the correct location.

# Story 1.2: Core Data Integration Planning

## Story

As an Analyst, I want to create a detailed data integration plan, so that the technical team has a clear roadmap for connecting our core data sources.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An audit of the existing marketing and data stack (GA4, CRM, ad platforms) is completed and documented.
2. A detailed data integration plan is created, mapping data points and defining API/CSV protocols for GA4, Supermetrics, and the CRM.
3. The integration plan is reviewed and approved by the technical lead and the Product Manager.
4. A sandbox environment for testing data integrations is requested and its setup is tracked.
5. The final integration plan is stored in the `docs/project-planning` directory.

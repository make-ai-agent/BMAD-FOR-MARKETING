# Story 1.1: Business Context Assessment and Team Setup

## Story

As a Product Manager, I want to conduct a business context assessment and set up the core marketing team, so that we have a shared understanding of the project's goals and the team is ready to execute.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A stakeholder alignment meeting is conducted to review and finalize the project scope, goals, and success metrics from the PRD.
2. The primary business type (e.g., SaaS, E-commerce) is confirmed and documented.
3. The four key roles (Brand, Media, Analyst, Designer) are formally assigned to team members.
4. Official communication channels for the team are established and documented (e.g., Slack/Teams channel).
5. A project kickoff presentation is created, summarizing the PRD and the plan for Phase 1.

## Technical Notes for Dev Agent

# Story 2.3: Cross-role Collaboration Workflow Testing

## Story

As a Team, we want to test the cross-role collaboration workflow, so that we can ensure smooth handoffs and effective communication between team members.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A small-scale test campaign is defined (e.g., "Promote a new blog post").
2. The team executes the test campaign following the documented Greenfield workflow.
3. Each role (Brand, Media, Analyst, Designer) completes their assigned tasks and hands off to the next role.
4. The team uses the designated communication channels for all project-related discussions.
5. A retrospective meeting is held to identify and document any friction points in the workflow.

## QA Plan

- Observe the workflow execution and communication.
- Review the artifacts created during the test campaign (e.g., content briefs, ad creatives, reports).
- Verify that the retrospective is held and its findings are documented.

# Story 3.2: Automated Reporting System Deployment

## Story

As a Developer, I want to deploy an automated reporting system, so that team members receive regular performance updates without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A script is created to generate a weekly performance report from the integrated data.
2. The report is automatically distributed to the team via email or Slack.
3. The report includes key metrics and trends for each of the four roles.
4. The reporting system is deployed to a server or serverless environment.
5. The system includes monitoring to ensure it runs reliably.

## QA Plan

- Verify that the automated report is received as scheduled.
- Check the accuracy of the data in the report.
- Confirm that the deployment includes adequate monitoring and alerting.

# Story 3.4: Performance Optimization Cycles

## Story

As a Team, we want to run our first performance optimization cycle, so that we can test and validate the full end-to-end BMAD framework.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The team uses an AI-generated insight from Story 3.1 to form a hypothesis.
2. The team follows the Brownfield workflow to plan and execute a test based on the hypothesis.
3. The results of the test are analyzed and compared against the baseline.
4. A decision is made to either implement the change or discard the hypothesis.
5. The entire cycle is documented, including the initial insight, the test plan, the results, and the decision.

## QA Plan

- Review the documentation for the optimization cycle for completeness and clarity.
- Verify that the team followed the documented Brownfield workflow.
- Confirm that the results of the test are statistically significant.

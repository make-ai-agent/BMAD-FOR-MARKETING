# Story 2.2: Supermetrics Data Pipeline Setup

## Story

As a Developer, I want to set up the Supermetrics data pipeline, so that we can consolidate marketing data from multiple ad platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An automated script is created to fetch data via Supermetrics API or CSV exports for Facebook Ads and Google Ads.
2. The script runs on a daily schedule.
3. The fetched data is stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON) in a designated location.
4. The pipeline includes basic error handling and logging.
5. The pipeline is documented in the `docs/project-planning` directory.

## QA Plan

- Verify that the script runs automatically as scheduled.
- Check the stored data for correctness and completeness against the source platforms.
- Review the error handling and logging mechanism.

# Story 4.1: Multi-business-type Workflow Adaptation

## Story

As a Product Manager, I want to adapt the workflow for a new business type, so that we can expand the applicability of the BMAD framework.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new business type (e.g., B2B Services) is selected for the adaptation.
2. The existing workflows and prompts are reviewed and modified to fit the new business type.
3. The data requirements for the new business type are documented.
4. A test run of the adapted workflow is completed with the team.
5. The adapted workflow and prompts are added to the knowledge base.

## QA Plan

- Review the adapted workflow and prompt documents for clarity and completeness.
- Verify that the data requirements for the new business type are documented.
- Observe the test run of the adapted workflow.
